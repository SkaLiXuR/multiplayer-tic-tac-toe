# Multiplayer tic tac toe

Multiplayer tic tac toe collaboration with @[ricsirogi](https://github.com/ricsirogi)

# how it works

couldnt be bothered

# how to use it

using [localtunnel](https://theboroer.github.io/localtunnel-www/) `npm install localtunnel`

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
1. `git clone` the main branch of the repo
69. Download the required Python libraries (Should be built-in to Python 3+)
420. `cd` to the `server/` folder
4123. run `npm install` to install dependencies for the server (assuming node.js and npm is installed)
321. run `npm run start`, and you should see a message that says `Listening on *:{port}`.
1236. in another terminal, run `lt -p {port} -s {name}` with port being the port that was given in step 5. name of the server is optional, but recommended
73231. `cd` to the `game/` folder, and run `python tictactoe.py` (both people should do this)
358. give the url you got in step 6 to your partner.
349. enjoy
174451230. (because i want it to be 10 steps) have fun
